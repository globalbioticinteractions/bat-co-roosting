One of us (Phillips) was hunting at 10:30 PM (tempera- ture 55° F) with a headlight with guide Jose Rodriquez in a fir forest when several flying bats appeared in the light beam. Phillips' attention was directed to the side of a large fir from which the bats seemed to be coming. The underside of a piece of bark (15 X 20 inches), loosened at the bottom from the tree trunk (diameter 4.5 ft) at about 15 ft above ground level, served as the roost. Phillips obtained 33 bats (15 males, 18 females ); at least two of the females were in lactation.	night roost	691	Author Observation					Baker_Phillips_1965	10.2307/1377953	https://www.jstor.org/stable/1377953	Baker, R.

This type of stem-tent construction in the flower and fruit clusters of Curyota urens has been  described  (BHAT & KUNZ 1995) and  referred to as a stem tent (KUNZ et al. 1994).		224	Literature Observation	Phillips_1924				Balasingh_etal_1995	10.1111/j.1439-0310.1995.tb00326.x	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1995.tb00326.x	Balasingh, J, J.

Wingless batflies (family Nycteribiidae) deposit full-term prepupa on leaves and twigs in bat roosts (Allison 1987). Some bats in America Samoa appear to be heavily infested with batflies. We frequently encountered numerous batflies on mist-netted bats and observed roosting bats scratching and abruptly shaking their wings presumably in response to parasitic flies and mosquitos. Interestly, bat flies were absent from 16 netted P. samoensis, which roost in pairs and have been observed to shift roosting trees on occasion (Banack, unpublished data). 		225	Anecdotal	Banack, unpublished data				Banack_1996		https://search.proquest.com/docview/304245190?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true	Banack, S.

In short tunnels the bats sometimes took refuge within 20 feet of the entrance in fairly bright light. Small groups were also found in natural rock shelters in the walls of the canyon. The mines used by the bats suggested thatMacrotus prefers a shelter with considerable ceiling surface and flying space. The mines were generally about 5-7 feet high and equally wide.	day roost	27	Literature Observation	Vaughan_1959				Barbour_Davis_1969	none	none	Barbour, R. W.,and W. H. Davis. 1969. Bats of America.

BarbourDavis1969-a280	Myotis sodalis		roosts in 			10						United States	Bat Caves, Carter Caves State Park, Kentucky			cave	ENVO_00000067					M. sodalis breeds in the caves in fall. At BatCave in Kentucky most breeding occurs during about 10 days in early October. At night the bats scatter in pairs over the ceiling of the cave where they can be seen copulating by the hundreds. The breeding occurs mostly in a large room near the upper entrance to the cave. During the day the bats cluster at several localities within the cave and the sexes are almost completely segregated. The males form clusters in the breeding room and the females at the other end of the cave, about 3,000feet away...The colony of about 100,000 M. sodalis hibernating in Bat Cave, Carter Caves State Park, Kentucky, begins to disperse in late March. The females begin leaving first to go to their summering grounds to the northwest. The greatest exodus occurs in late April when nearly half the populationleaves within a week. By the end of the first week of May the cave is vacant. A few males usually remain in the vicinity, and can be netted at the cave entrance at night. Most males,however, migrate to the northwest.	maternity	88						Barbour_Davis_1969	none	none	Barbour, R. W.,and W. H. Davis. 1969. Bats of America. Univ. Kentucky Press, Lexington, 286 pp.	ACS

Pallid batswere not seen about the ranch during spring and summer of1948, but in the latter part of October they began to use someof the buildings for night roosts. Each morning numerousfresh droppings and insect fragments were found on the floorbeneath the beams where the bats rested. After the middleof November bats were no longer seen. In 1949 they appearedduring the second week in October. Each evening McMillanplaced clean sacks beneath the roosts. After October 25, therewas a gradual decrease in the number of nightly droppingsuntil November 1, when there were but two droppings, andnone were found during the rest of the year.	night roost	188	Literature Observation	Orr (1954)				Barbour_Davis_1969	none	none	Barbour, R.

BarbourDavis1969-a751	Eumops perotis		roosts in 									United States	Eagle Creek, Arizona			rock shelter	ENVO_00000481					We next decided to try Cockrum’s locality on Eagle Creekin Arizona. Here the bats are in a crevice at the top of a rock shelter about 50 feet above the ground. Since the batsdrop about 10 feet in launching themselves, we decided toset the nets about 40 feet high to catch them. We boughtseveral lengths of different sizes of conduit, and set out tobuild a net pole by fitting them together. We made two poles,each of which was 28 feet long.The rock shelter is about 60 feet across at the front, justright for our 60-foot nets. We could climb the cliff on bothsides far enough easily to get the nets up to 40 feet. We puttwo nets together to make a wider surface and erected it (fig.115). The arrangement was surprisingly suecessful. Whendarkness arrived the first Eumops emerged and struck thenet.		227	Author Observation					Barbour_Davis_1969	none	none	Barbour, R. W.,and W. H.

In nearly every large colony in Kentucky many thousandscan be seen crawling on the beams where the bats rest.They stay close to the bats and only rarely appear in the roomsdownstairs.

BarbourDavis1969-p47	Myotis lucifugus	Cimex sp.	parisitized by	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002445																		The species harbors a few fleas and numerous mites during summer. Mites can be found on the wing membranes of most individuals. The most conspicuous parasite is the large bat bug, Cimex sp. These bugs are occasionally seen on the forearm of a bat but are much more frequently encountered in the summer roost. In a roost inhabited by a large colony of bats the bugs can be seen by the thousands. All sizes are present. They sometimes are so abundant as to nearly cover the rafters where the bats hang. Cimex is responsible for the common rumor that bats carry bedbugs. Such an idea is understandable, for these bugs are closely related and similar in appearance. Although most bugs stay near the bats, some occasionally move down out of the attic where they come to the attention of man. This seems to happen more frequently when the bats have been shut out of a building, or have left the site for the winter. 		53						Barbour_Davis_1969	none	none	Barbour, R. W.,and W. H. Davis. 1969.

Hall (1946) noted several instances of these bats beingtaken at night in trees where they apparently had alighted toobtain insects. On July 5, 1966, we obtained evidence suggestingthat pallid bats feed in the inflorescence of agave. Wenetted 22 individuals over a pond in Big Bend National Park.All but two of them were heavily covered with pollen, whichwas particularly noticeable on both surfaces of the wings. Itwas well scattered over the body surface except the top ofthe head and neck. Since the known pollen feeder, Leptonycterisnivalis, captured at the same time, had pollenprimarily on the head, neck, and shoulders, it seems likelythat the Antrozous were not feeding upon the pollen ornectar. Most likely they were alighting on the large inflorescencesto forage for insects among the flowers.		191	Author Observation			flower	forest	Barbour_Davis_1969	none	none	Barbour, R. W.,and W. H.

Close analysis showed, however, that they did notreally hover, but that the feeding was done during a brakingwingbeat. The bats did not back off from the flower butturned at the last instant.

The bats inhabited a hollow 2 m above the ground in a live aspen (Populus tremu- loides). The roost entrance was a gap between the bark and inner wood extending vertically for 20-30 cm and the bats roosted above the entrance, under the bark. This tree was located in a stand of aspen and spruce (Picea glauca) approximately 250 m from the lake and amongst a dozen summer cottages.		782	Author Observation					Barclay_Cash_1985	10.2307/1380808	https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-abstract/66/4/782/848146	Barclay, R.

The gave was at an altitude of 1600 metres (5200 feet)and was situated in a rather dense karst forest, whichwas subtropic in character, with Dracena and anevergreen Quercus as the dominant plant species. Nearby was a large stream. A single specimen wascollected at 5.40 pm on 19 November 1967, some 4 5minutes after nightfall. It was flying into the cave fromthe outside and was caught some 60-70 cm above theground. The cave was possibly its nocturnal restingarea; it was not used as a diurnal roost. The previousnight some three individuals of this species had beenobserved in this same cave at 5.30 pm (Topal, 1970b).	night roost	161-162	Literature Observation	Topal (1970b)				Bates_Harrison_2405			Bates, P.

(2'31'S, 55'OO'W)			tree		fallen tree		cavity in fallen tree		On 6 May 1998. during a survey of the bat fauna of Alter do Chao. near Santarern, Para State. Brazil(2'31'S, 55'OO'W), I found a roost of P. leucoptera...Twelve white-winged bats (fable 1) were roosting in an unidentified. dead. hollow tree that was lying onthe ground in an 8-ha forested area. The trunk of the tree was 10m long and ca. 1.5 m m diameter. Therewas one main entrance at the base of the fallen tree and three smaller openings along the trunk...The colony consisted of three adult females (one carrying a young). three adult males. and five subadults, all grouped together. This grouping suggests the lack of harems. and the presence of several subadults, as well as pregnant females, may indicate that the colony was a maternity roost.	maternity	37	Author Observation					Bernard_1999			Bernard, E. 1999.

Unfortunately, large trees, both live and dead, are often most valued by humans for lumber, other wood products, and firewood,. There is tremendous political pressure in our study region to increase salwage logging of large tracts of timber killed by recent insect attacks and drought before the trees lose their value through decay and before they fuel a devastating fire. Lumber companies want large trees as well as small, but even if only the smaller ones are removed the remaining isolated ones are more than likely to fall in a windstorm.

This phenomenon was not observed in either West Berlin or in Poznań. In both these cities, as was the case at Modlin and MFR, the structure of the community and the large numbers of hibernating bats were to a great extent determined by the presence of numerous and relatively extensive fortifications. At Puławy the artificial cave played a similar role.		366	Literature Observation	Krzanowski, 1959				Bogdanowicz_1983			Bogdanowicz W.

In both types ofapproach, the initial response of a squirrel monkey on identifying a tent was toapproach closely from the side or below and to visually inspect it. A leap at the battent flushed the bats immediately. Only once was a squirrel monkey clearly seen tocapture a juvenile bat (Artibeus watsoni) that had been knocked to the ground. Aftercapture, the 4-year-old male monkey delivered seven sharp bites to the head. He then climbed to a 2-m-high branch (most likely to avoid three curious juveniles) and proceeded to consume the entire bat in 1 minute 40 seconds.		123-124	Author Observation					Boinski_Timm_1985	10.1002/ajp.1350090205	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajp.1350090205	Boinski, S., and R.

Between 1970 and 1974, 35 different day roost locations were mapped and 24 of these were actually visited and monitored for extended periods. In 1974, the nearest neighbor distances between known roosts of Hypsignathus ranged between 0.4 and 6 km. As will be shown below, the cryptic nature of the day roosts and their sparse distribution over kilometers of uniform habitat make it virtually impossible to locate them by any means other than radio-tracking. All day roosts show a similar configuration. The bats typically roost high in the forest canopy at heights of from 20 to 30 m. Roosts are always exposed branches beneath a dense umbrella of vegetation. Usually access to the roosting branch is guaranteed by apparent selection for sites with few nearby lianas and epiphytes and several m gap between roost and understory.No preference for particular species of roost trees was noted.	day roost	244-245	Author Observation		24			Bradbury_1977a			Bradbury, J.

One lucky observation suggests that females carry non-volant youngto other trees and leave them hidden while foraging. A female from the Restanharem in Bush Bush flew from the roost to another tree some 60 m distantand landed. She gently pushed the baby bat off her teat and it began togroom and stretch its wings. The female then left and began foraging nearby. Thebaby was still roosting quietly on the tree some 3 h later, but was back onthe roost with its mother the next morning.

Three species specific to deserts, or semidesertsfrom the Old World, a species found as far as Sumatra.BIOLOGY [14, 100, 544].The distribution is related to aridity factors, and varies with these factors.In addition, Rhinopomas are absent from regions with cold winters: northernSahara, cold deserts of Asia.Caves and rock shelters constitute the primitive diurnal environment. CornRhinopomas have adapted to human environments, populating monuments,Pyramids in Egypt, palaces and temples in India, wells, inhabited housesand the Saharan rhettara. The most numerous colonies are linked toremains of ancient civilizations.

Two species from the Sunda Islands.BIOLOGY [425-426,491]: M. torquatus Horsfield (fig. 75), M. parvidens Millerand Hollister.Cheiromeles are remarkable for their large size, lack of peeling, and the possession of lateral membranous pockets in which theseChiroptera fold their wings. According to Kitchener, the day shelter would be intree holes, but Lord Medway observed the species in aSarawak. The colony, 18 to 20,000 individuals strong, gathered in swarmscompact. The behavior is noisy. These large Chiroptera hunt irregularly,and do not leave their lodge every night. Despite their badsmell, they are eaten by the Dayak people.	day roost	191	Literature Observation	425-426,491				Brosset_1966a			Brosset, A.1966. La Biologie des Chiropteres.

Maternity roost trees used by members of each colony were found by attaching radiotransmitters (Holohil Systems Ltd., Woodlawn, Ontario) to Indiana bats and subsequently relocating them at their roosts in daylight during 1989 and 1990...Bats were netted over streams at night from15 May to 15 August using mist nets extendedto a height of 6 m (Gardner et al., 1989).	maternity	819	Author Observation					Callahan_etal_1997			Callahan, E.

As the following observations demonstrate, this bat is probably resident southeastern Clark County, Nevada, at least during the summer months. Musgrove visited a mine on Jackass Flats, 4 1/2 miles N Davis Dam, 3/4 miles W Mohave, about 800 feet elevation, Clark County, Nevada, on 9 April 1961 with his advanced science class from Kingman (Arizona) High School. On this date he observed 20 California leaf-nosed bats, Macrotus californicus. The mine consisted of a series of interconnected shafts and rooms. In places much guano was present, leading to the supposition that the mine was used as a summer roost by some other species		636	Author Observation					Cockrum_Musgrove_1964			Cockrum,E.L.,and B. F.

Numerous mammalogists have visited the cave (see bibliography) since the senior author first collected specimens there (Dalquest and Hall, 1947). Thousands of free-tailed bats belonging to two otherwise rare species of Tadarida then inhabited the cave, but the population has been greatly reduced, perhaps by rabies (Villa, 1967), and in 1966 we found no Tadarida living in the cave		217	Literature Observation	Dalquest and Hall, 1947				Dalquest_Roth_1970			Dalquest, W.W., and E.

Peale's free-tailed bat is a rare species, first reported from Mexico at Cueva de Abra by Carter and Davis (1961) and since found at several other localities (Villa, 1966). Jaws and teeth of aurispinosa are distinctly larger than those of T. laticaudata or T. femorosaca. T. molossa (Pal- las) has teeth only slightly larger but has jaws and rostrum greatly elongated, with teeth widely spaced, as compared with T. aurispinosa. We have examined several hundred free-tailed bats, taken or found dead at Cueva de Abra. Three of these were aurispinosa and all of the rest were laticaudata. The collection of fossils suggests that aurispinosa has been relatively rare at Cueva de Abra since the late Pleistocene.		223	Author Observation					Dalquest_Roth_1970			Dalquest, W.W., and E.

Approximately 7 km to the north andwest is Barmah Forest, an extensive floodplainwoodland (29,000 ha) of River Red Gum adjacentto the Murray River. Miniature radio transmitterswere temporarily attached to 45 individual LesserLong-eared Bats and 27 Gould’s Wattled Bats.Individuals were trapped at night while they foragedin remnant woodland amongst farmland and then, during the day, they were tracked back to their roostsites, generally in hollow-bearing trees...Gould’s Wattled Batsfavoured large, old, live River Red Gums with amean diameter of 120 cm. Trees of this size are rare,and were significantly larger than trees in thesurrounding area. Roost sites were usually in a deadspout with an opening approximately 9 cm in width(Fig. 6).		43, 45-46	Author Observation					Davison_1992			Balancing Conservation and Production in Grassy Landscapes: Proceedings of the Bushcare Grassy Landscapes Conference, Clare, South Australia, 19- 21 August 1999	ACS

Muierilor(GJ) 1930.05.25., one male leg. Chappuis &Winkler, in ISERC no. 1380) and in 1951 byDumitrescu et al. (1962-1963b). The cave was repeatedly visited over the next sevenyears, but observations regarding the batfauna were made only during spring andsummer seasons. For this period, theauthors recorded the presence of four batspecies: Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R.hipposideros, Myotis myotis/oxygnathus andMiniopterus schreibersii. After that, the cave came to bat researcher’s attention only in1974, when Bazilescu started a systematicalresearch of the bat fauna from Oltenia(Bazilescu 1974).

It was caught,suspended head downwards, on a cluster of the round fruit of theLongan-tree (Nephelium longanum). Now this tree is an evergreen; and all the year through some portion of its foliage isundergoing decay, the particular leaves being, in such a stage,partially orange and black. This bat can, therefore, at allseasons, suspend from its branches, and elude its enemies by itsresemblar.ce to the leaf of the tree.
